### Hey! I'm Sam.
I'm a student at Rutgers University- New Brunswick studying Computer Science plus an additional degree in business. I'm currently a Student Systems Programmer at Rutgers Open Systems Solutions, and an incoming Software Engineering intern at Capital One for Summer 2021. Outside of school, I love playing tennis and performing in theater productions!
